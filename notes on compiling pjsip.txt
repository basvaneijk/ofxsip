How to compile pjsip for openframeworks (for the mac)

I'm not 100% on this, but I think oF currently only works if you compile it for i386, and not x86_64 - I think it's something to do with quicktime. Therefore, when compiling pjsip, you've got to make sure it's compiled for i386, or you can't link it to an oF project.

There's no proper way to compile pjsip for i386 using ./configure, but I've found a way as listed below...

To force pjsip to compile for i386 architecture on the mac (if you have a 64 bit machine) you run configure as normal, but before running make, you need to edit build/host-unix.mak and change it so the last 4 lines read:

export HOST_SOURCES :=
export HOST_CFLAGS := -arch i386
export HOST_CXXFLAGS :=
export HOST_LDFLAGS := -arch i386


Then, there's one issue with pjsip - in the "third party" folder, there's a library called ilbc. ilbc has a function called window(...). Openframeworks also has a function or symbol called window, so you need to change the name of this to get it to work. It's defined in ilbc/helpfun.h. I renamed it and all calls to it ilbc_window() and it compiled fine.

then run:
make dep && make

this should compile everything except the test (there's an error), but the static libraries should be created.

Then you need to find all the .a files and put them in ofxSip (in the lib folder).
